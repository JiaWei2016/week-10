# Final Project Proposal

Your assignment this week is to write a detailed proposal for your final
project. In proposing your final, try to address each of the following
areas.

## Problem / Question

In this project, I aims to map out Philadelphia crash point. This map will conclude
information such as crash point, crash type, crash time and causes. Users are able to
type in their stating location and destination. The safest route will be created.

## The data
Data are available on OpenDataPhilly

## Technologies used

Which technologies covered in class (or discovered on your own!) do you
plan to use? How do you anticipate using each of these technologies?

Review the APIs/online examples of leaflet, turf, jQuery, underscore (or
any library not explicitly covered in class) for functions/uses which
you'd like to explore. Briefly describe how you might use them.

The most of technologies would be covered in this project.

## Design spec

#### User experience

At a high level, how do you expect people to use your application?
- Who are the users?
  People who are care about the safety will be the users.
- What do they gain from your application' use?
  They are able to get the safest route.
- Are there any website/application examples in the wild to which you can compare your final?

#### Layouts and visual design

So far, we've built all our applications with a side bar for
representing non-map content and navigation. This is not the only
successful design. Extra content could be displayed in a top bar,
through modals, through side bars on both sides, and any combination of
these as well as a number not mentioned. Try to describe your
application's visual layout. Conceptually (no need for extensive CSS
here), what will this design require?

A sidebar will show the crash information such as crash point, crash type, crash time and causes.
At each point, there will a popup. And there will be a selection tool for uses to select stating
location and destination.

## Anticipated difficulties

Thinking about weaknesses can be useful. What do you anticipate being
most difficult about this project? How will you attempt to cope with
these difficulties? For example, asynchronous behavior (ajax, events)
are hard to use and think about. Global variables are a strategy for
coping with that difficulty by breaking data out of the asynchronous
context.

The most difficult part may be to create the safest route basing on crash data.

## Missing pieces

We've only managed to scratch the surface of the available technologies
by which you could construct an application. What use-cases haven't we covered
that you think would be useful? What technologies not covered seem exciting to
you (you don't necessarily have to fully understand what they're for,
this is a chance for you to get our help interpreting a technology's
purpose/usage).
